      <p>Hi i'm isabella, 20 years old and a capricorn.
         I enjoy cool sunny days; napping with my cat whiskers while listening to steve lacy.
         While i may seem aloof, distant and cold i'm not. im just natrually a very reserved person.  
         I have a one year old cat named whiskers. He's a rescue animal.
         My hobby's include reading manga and curating the best storys; drawing; Watching viedos on history; playing video games and listening to music.
         While I don't watch much anime my favorite is Aggretsuko. i relate to the main character alot. Watching the show is deeply theraputic.
